        <p translate>
            During my training as a frontend developer, I independently or collaboratively crafted various
            projects.
            The daily routine of a developer was already experienced, involving regular calls, meeting
            deadlines,
            conducting code reviews, and both team and individual work. I am eager to apply these experiences as
            I
            transition into the role of a Junior Web Developer, contributing to dynamic projects and the success
            of
            a collaborative team.

            <p translate>This portfolio was programmed using Angular, TypeScript, and SCSS. I am working on making the

            <p translate>You can find more projects on my GitHub page. Many of them were for practice and therefore
                are not included in this portfolio.</p>
