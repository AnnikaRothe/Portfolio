            <p> I'm excited about being a Junior Web Developer, contributing to exciting projects and the success of a new
                team. I'm dedicated to continually expanding my knowledge. Currently, I am exploring the world of CMS
                and started a course for PHP, while also deepening my existing skills in JavaScript, Angular,
                TypeScript, and more.
